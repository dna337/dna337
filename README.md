Hello, welcome to my profile!
I am a Scratch-Based programmer looking to get a better grip on other programming languages.
I have a large online presence, and have went by many names, but for now, you can refer to me as "dna337", or just "dna" for short.
(Although it's only a three character difference.)
My Scratch profile as of me writing this is 4 years and 2 months old, and goes by the username "lil_doggy", don't ask why.
